*** SPECIAL CONSIDERATION ***

Special consideration is available for Loxone GmbH, or for entities explicitly designated by Loxone GmbH.
If Loxone GmbH desires a less restrictive license (for example, for inclusion in the official Loxone Library, redistribution with commercial products, or other internal or customer-facing uses), they are encouraged to contact the author with details of the licensing requirements they need or prefer.

The author is likely to agree to alternative or less restrictive licensing terms in such cases. Having Loxone’s support and participation is important to the author, and licensing flexibility is offered in good faith to facilitate that collaboration.
